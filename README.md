# coreminer_scripts
<br>
these are some simple scripts to start coreminer on your Linux System<br>
simply wget the scripts and excecute them with bash<br>
All done within your start directory of Linux distro (mostly your homefolder)<br>
example<br>

wget -P ./ "https://github.com/crypto-MMXXII/coreminer_scripts/releases/download/coreminer/start_corminer.sh"<br>
and the second one<br>
wget -P ./ "https://github.com/crypto-MMXXII/coreminer_scripts/releases/download/coreminer/create_coreminer.sh"<br>
after download check if the files are there with the command <br>
ls -ltr<br>
example output:<br>
$ $ ls<br>
create_coreminer.sh  start_corminer.sh<br>
now if this is done just use the first script to create the mining env.<br>
bash create_coreminer.sh<br>
and after that start the miner<br>
start_corminer.sh<br>
now configure the miner with your coreminer address and start mining. <br>
